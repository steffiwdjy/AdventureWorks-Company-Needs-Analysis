### Company Profile
Adventure Works Cycles is a fictional company that manufactures and sells bicycles and related products. The AdventureWorks database is designed to simulate a real-world business environment and includes data related to:
- Manufacturing processes
- Sales transactions
- Purchasing activities
- Product management
- Contact management
- Human resources

### Business Needs
1. Increase Sales Efficiency \
   The company aims to enhance its buying and selling power by focusing on promotional email campaigns targeted at individual retail customers. This initiative is intended to boost sales through personalized marketing strategies.

2. Territory Performance Evaluation \
   The company needs to evaluate the performance of territories with TerritoryIDs 2, 3, and 5, as these regions have reported losses compared to sales in the previous year. One approach is to analyze and provide the most frequently chosen ShipMethodID by customers in these territories to optimize the shipping options offered.

3. Production and Inventory Enhancement \
There is a need to increase production or inventory for products in the region with Territory Code FR and TerritoryID 4. Specifically, ProductID 712, which is the most purchased product by customers in these regions, should be prioritized for increased production to meet the demand.

4. Employee Bonus Evaluation \
   The company should reconsider the bonus amounts provided to employees. The current bonus structure does not significantly impact the company's profit margins. By reducing bonus amounts, the company can help minimize expenses and mitigate losses.

### Project Goals
- Analyze customer data to create targeted email marketing campaigns.
- Evaluate and optimize shipping methods for underperforming territories.
- Increase production for high-demand products in specific regions.
- Reassess employee bonus structures to align with company profitability goals.

### Technologies Used
- SQL: For querying and managing the AdventureWorks database.
- Python: For data analysis and visualization.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Tableau: For data visualization.

### Conclusion
This project aims to address the critical business needs of Adventure Works Cycles by leveraging data analysis to inform strategic decisions in marketing, shipping, production, and employee compensation. Through targeted solutions, the company can improve its operational efficiency, increase sales, and enhance overall profitability.
